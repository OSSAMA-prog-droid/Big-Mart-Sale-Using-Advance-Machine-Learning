# Big-Mart-Sale-Using-Advance-Machine-Learning

⦁	Introduction
As time is passing day by day the technology is improving. We can use the technology help in almost every field of work now a day. Keeping this
thing in mind we are using technology to build a sales prediction model in big marts by using a machine learning models.as we now these marts have an
exponential business and they have a different branches in different parts of world they have many products too sale .we can make such a system which 
will predict the sale of each product. 
        
⦁	Objective
    To build a system which will predict the annual sales of each product which is present in each branch of mart.

⦁	Problem Description:
To digitalize the concept of sales by designing a sale prediction system to facilitate a store manager to analyze from the previous data that
which item makes more revenue as the year passes and which item is still on same revenue having no percentage increase after a year. So this 
system enables the store manager to analyze this data and the money which it invests in non-increased revenue item to invest it in the more
revenue generated item whose percentage increases as a year passes.
